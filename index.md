# Google Summer of Code 2020 - Final Report

## Integration of Kenzo program with SimplicialSets

# Overview

[This project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4580455350796288) consisted in improving the interface between the [Kenzo Program](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/) and [SageMath](sagemath.org), whose initial version was worked in ticket [\# 27880](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27880). That ticket makes it possible to communicate both computer algebra programs and enhances the SageMath system with new capabilities in algebraic topology, such as the computation of homotopy groups and some kind of spectral sequences, dealing in particular with simplicial objects of infinite nature.
